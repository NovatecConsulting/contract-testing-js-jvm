# Example project for the use of a js consumer and js provider with the Pact framework.

This project is a modified version of [DiUS Pact JS Workshop](https://github.com/DiUS/pact-workshop-js).
It has 2 components, a js consumer project and a js service provider.

Run the spec and see it all pass:

```
$ npm run test:consumer

> pact-js-js@1.0.0 test:pact:consumer /home/nt/Git/pact-js-js
> mocha consumer/test/consumerPact.spec.js



  Pact with Our Provider
    given data count > 0
      when a call to the Provider is made
        and a valid date is provided
          ✓ can process the JSON payload from the provider
          ✓ should validate the interactions and create a contract
        and an invalid date is provided
          ✓ can handle an invalid date parameter
          ✓ should validate the interactions and create a contract
        and no date is provided
          ✓ can handle missing date parameter
          ✓ should validate the interactions and create a contract
    given data count == 0
      when a call to the Provider is made
        and a valid date is provided
          ✓ can handle missing data
          ✓ should validate the interactions and create a contract

Use the created pact file to validate our assumptions on the provider side.

To validate the pact generated by the consumer execute it against the provider:

```console
npm run test:pact:provider

> pact-js-js@1.0.0 test:pact:provider /home/nt/Git/pact-js-js
> mocha provider/test/providerPact.spec.js
